# Concept to look at
 - Sparse rewards: A sparse reward task is typically characterized by a meagre amount of states in the state space that return a feedback signal. A typical situation is a situation where an agent has to reach a goal and only receives a positive reward signal when he is close enough to the target.


# Definition of concept

### Task
- A task is an instance of the reinforcement learning (RL) problem
- **Continuing tasks** are tasks that continue forever, without end
- **Episodic tasks** are tasks with a well-defined starting and ending point.
  - In this case, we refer to a complete sequence of interaction, from start to finish, as an **episode**.
  - Episodic tasks come to an end whenever the agent reaches a **terminal state**.
